<div class="photoDescription">Icehouse Canyon trail was really pretty with all the cedar and oak trees and the creek next to the trail.</div>
<div id="parking" class="sectionHeader">Parking</div>
<p>There was a parking lot near the Icehouse Canyon trailhead, however at around 10am, when we got there it was full. Many people parked along the road. We parked along the road 5-minute walk away from the trailhead.</p>

<div class="photoDescription">Closer to the Cedar Gleen campground, the trees thinned out revealing the view of the mountains. </div>
<div id="trail" class="sectionHeader">Trail</div>
<p>We started at the Icehouse Canyon trailhead. The first two miles were well-shaded and along a creek. The elevation gain was minimal. Then we took a fork off the icehouse canyon trail and hiked another mile to the campsite. The second part of the trail had numerous switchbacks. As we gained elevation, the trees thinned out, and the last stretch we walked in the sun without any shade. </p>

<div class="photoDescription">Cedar Glenn campground was well shaded and had many curious blue jays who came to check out what we were doing.</div>
<div id="campground" class="sectionHeader">Campground</div>
<p>Cedar Glenn campground had a nice flat area that is not too large with cedar trees. There is a small hill that you can climb with scenic overlook. The city is visible in the distance, and at sunset, the Los Angeles city skyline became visible. At night, the city lights looked beautiful in the distance. </p>

<div id="water" class="sectionHeader">Water Source</div>
<p>There was a small creek near campsite.  It was accessible in two locations from the trail, maybe 5-10 minute walk away from the campsite. Although there were many yellow jackets in the area, it is still possible to get to the water. </p>
