<h1>Daytrip to Kamakura and Enoshima</h1>
<p>Kamakura, an ancient capital of Japan, is about an hour train ride away from Tokyo. We took an express train on Shonan-Shinjuku line to Kita-Kamakura station, which took about an hour and cost about 1000 yen one-way.</p>
<p>Our itinerary consisted of:  Daibutsu trail, Great Buddha and Enoshima.</p>

<div class="photoDescription">On the way to Daibutsu trail from Kita-Kamakura Station, to our right were residential houses. An entrance to someone's house had a beautiful garden with an gate overgrown by moss.</div>
<p>The short walk from the Kita-Kamakura station to the trailhead of Daibutsu trail was scenic with forest on our left and residential houses on our right.</p>

<div class="photoDescription">Kamakura trail had many of these steps. It was a cloudy day which added to the moodiness of the scenery.</div>
<p>The Daibutsu trail goes through a beautiful forest. Even though we were close to the city, it still felt wild. </p>

<div class="photoDescription">Kamakura city and the ocean were visible on our hike to Great Buddha.</div>
<p>As we came out of the forest, we visited a temple on our way, and proceeded through paved road down to Kamakura to see the Great Buddha.The statue has survived a tsunami, however the temple that housed it did not. So now the Great Buddha meditates outside in open air. </p>

<p>Enoshima is a small island a short walk over the bridge from mainland. A busy touristy street goes through Enoshima. Enoshima is like a small mountain. There is a temple at the top and lighthouse observation deck. All along the road, there are numerous shops and restaurants. If you walk all the way to the other side of the island, you can visit Iwaya caves for 500 yen. </p>
